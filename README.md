# Live-API-Data-Integration-Real-Time-Dashboards-with-Python-Power-BI
This project focuses on building a live,interactive dashboard that shows important global statistics such as health,education,employment and other key indicators.The data comes from a public API that is regularly updated with the latest information.Using Python,we write a script that automatically fetches this data from the API and processes it for analysis.
